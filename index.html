<h1 align="center"><u>World Hepatitis Day</u></h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>World Hepatitis Day, observed on July 28 every year, aims to raise global awareness of hepatitis — a group of infectious diseases known as Hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E — and encourage prevention, diagnosis and treatment. Hepatitis affects hundreds of millions of people worldwide, causing acute and chronic disease and killing close to 1.34 million people every year. Hepatitis causes liver diseases and can also kill a person.In some countries hepatitis B is commonest cause of cirrhosis and may also cause liver cancer(HCC).
</p>
<p>World Hepatitis Day is one of 11 official global public health campaigns marked by the World Health Organization (WHO), along with World Health Day, World Chagas Disease Day, World Blood Donor Day, World Malaria Day, World Immunization Week, World Tuberculosis Day, World No Tobacco Day, World Patient Safety Day, World Antimicrobial Awareness Week and World AIDS Day.

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Hepatitis groups, patients and advocates worldwide take part in events on 28 July. Notably in 2012, a Guinness World Record was created when 12,588 people from 20 countries did the Three Wise Monkeys actions on World Hepatitis Day to signify the willful ignorance of the disease.
</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>The inaugural International Hepatitis C Awareness day, coordinated by various European and Middle Eastern Patient Groups and Baby Muriel, took place on October 1, 2004. However, many patient groups continued to mark 'hepatitis day' on disparate dates. For this reason in 2008, the World Hepatitis Alliance in collaboration with patient groups declared May 19 the first global World Hepatitis Day.
</p>
<p>Following the adoption of a resolution during the 63rd World Health Assembly in May 2010, World Hepatitis Day was given global endorsement as the primary focus for national and international awareness-raising efforts and the date was changed to July 28 (in honour of Nobel Laureate Baruch Samuel Blumberg, discoverer of the hepatitis B virus, who celebrates his birthday on that date). The resolution resolves that "28 July shall be designated as World Hepatitis Day in order to provide an opportunity for education and greater understanding of viral hepatitis as a global public health problem, and to stimulate the strengthening of preventive and control measures of this disease in Member States."
</p>
<p>World Hepatitis Day is now recognised in over 100 countries each year through events such as free screenings, poster campaigns, demonstrations, concerts, talk shows, flash mobs and vaccination drives, amongst many others. Each year a report is published by the WHO and the World Hepatitis Alliance detailing all the events across the world.

<h2>Themes</h2>
<p>World Hepatitis Day provides an opportunity to focus on actions such as:
<ul type="square">
     <li>Raising awareness of the different forms of hepatitis and how they are transmitted;</li>
     <li>Strengthening prevention, screening and control of viral hepatitis and its related diseases;</li>
     <li>Increasing hepatitis B vaccine coverage and integration into national immunization programmes; and</li>
     <li>Coordinating a global response to hepatitis.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Each year focuses on a specific theme. The list of themes is as follows:
<ol type="I">
     <li><b>2011</b>: Hepatitis affects everyone, everywhere. Know it. Confront it. Confront her.</b></li>

     <li><b>2013</b>: More must be done to stop this silent killer.</li>
     <li><b>2014</b>: Hepatitis: Think Again.</li>
     <li><b>2015</b>: Prevention of viral Hepatitis. Act now.</li>
     <li><b>2016</b>: Know Hepatitis-Act now.</li>
     <li><b>2017</b>: Eliminate Hepatities.</li>
     <li><b>2018</b>: Test. Treat. Hepatitis.</li>
     <li><b>2019</b>: Invest in eliminating hepatitis.</li>
     <li><b>2020</b>: Hepatitis Free Future.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<h2>Simple Ways To Prevent Hepatitis</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water after any potential exposure to blood.</li>
    <li>Avoid direct contact with blood and bodily fluids.</li>
    <li>Clean up blood spills with a fresh diluted bleach solution (mix 1 part bleach with 9 parts water).</li>
    <li>Cover all cuts carefully.</li>
    <li>Avoid sharing sharp items such as razors, nail clippers, toothbrushes, and earrings or body rings.</li>
    <li>Discard sanitary napkins and tampons into plastic bags.</li>
    <li>Make sure new, sterile needles are used for ear or body piercing, tattoos, and acupuncture.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Treatment Of Hepatitis</h2>
<p><b>Hepatitis A</b></p>
<p>Hepatitis A usually doesn’t require treatment because it’s a short-term illness. Bed rest may be recommended if symptoms cause a great deal of discomfort. If you experience vomiting or diarrhea, follow your doctor’s orders for hydration and nutrition.</p>
<p>The hepatitis A vaccine is available to prevent this infection. Most children begin vaccination between ages 12 and 18 months. It’s a series of two vaccines. Vaccination for hepatitis A is also available for adults and can be combined with the hepatitis B vaccine.</p>
<p><b>Hepatitis B</b></p>
<p>Acute hepatitis B doesn’t require specific treatment.</p>
<p>Chronic hepatitis B is treated with antiviral medications. This form of treatment can be costly because it must be continued for several months or years. Treatment for chronic hepatitis B also requires regular medical evaluations and monitoring to determine if the virus is responding to treatment.</p>
<p>Hepatitis B can be prevented with vaccination. The CDCTrusted Source recommends hepatitis B vaccinations for all newborns. The series of three vaccines is typically completed over the first six months of childhood. The vaccine is also recommended for all healthcare and medical personnel</p>
<p><b>Hepatitis C</b></p>
<p>Antiviral medications are used to treat both acute and chronic forms of hepatitis C. People who develop chronic hepatitis C are typically treated with a combination of antiviral drug therapies. They may also need further testing to determine the best form of treatment.</p>
<p>People who develop cirrhosis (scarring of the liver) or liver disease as a result of chronic hepatitis C may be candidates for a liver transplant.</p>
<p>Currently, there is no vaccination for hepatitis C.</p>
<p><b>Hepatitis D</b></p>
<p>No antiviral medications exist for the treatment of hepatitis D at this time. According to a 2013 studyTrusted Source, a drug called alpha interferon can be used to treat hepatitis D, but it only shows improvement in about 25 to 30 percent of people.</p>
<p>Hepatitis D can be prevented by getting the vaccination for hepatitis B, as infection with hepatitis B is necessary for hepatitis D to develop.</p>
<p><b>Hepatitis E</b></p>
<p>Currently, no specific medical therapies are available to treat hepatitis E. Because the infection is often acute, it typically resolves on its own. People with this type of infection are often advised to get adequate rest, drink plenty of fluids, get enough nutrients, and avoid alcohol. However, pregnant women who develop this infection require close monitoring and care.</p>
